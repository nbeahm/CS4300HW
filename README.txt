This assignment gave me some trouble in hosting DevEdu on my local machine. Some aspects of the website would not load, which forced me to run the code in multiple spots at times to get the 
proper output. I used AI to generate my tests and my HTML files: I used Copilot AI for all my prompts, which I prompted to give me simple pages for the models and code, which I used in my project
in order to run this code, use python3 manage.py runserver, or to test run python3 manage.py test. I also used AI to double-check my work.


To run this code on a local machine, download the files and with python installed, navigate your terminal to the folder where manage.py is, and run python (or python3) manage.py runserver
To run this code on Render, connect the GitHub to Render's blueprint, then run the most recent commit.
for both of these, you should see yourself on the api page, allowing you to navigate to movies and bookings. 
You should be able to book a seat at any of the movies, and then you should be redirected to the bookings page to see the booking you just made.
