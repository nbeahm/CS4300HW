This assignment gave me some trouble in hosting DevEdu on my local machine. Some aspects of the website would not load, which forced me to run the code in multiple spots at times to get the 
proper output. I used AI to generate my tests and my HTML files: I used copilot AI for all my prompts, which I prompted to give me simple pages for the models and code, which I used in my project
in order to run this code, use python3 manage.py runserver, or to test run python3 manage.py test

I was able to get render to work with my website, though I don't know how well it is working now since I had to move to a new repo and didn't get a lot of time to test it
